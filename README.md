# IBM Quantum Challenge - Fall 2020  

These are the solutions I submitted for the [IBM Quantum Challenge - Fall 2020](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/challenges)  
The solutions are in `exercises`, completed "mini-games" in `quizzes`, and the hints given after completing the "mini-games" are in `hints` .  
The original repo with all the materials and official solutions are at [/qiskit-community/IBMQuantumChallenge2020](https://github.com/qiskit-community/IBMQuantumChallenge2020)

## Description  
The solutions are coded in `exXX_en.ipynb` in the `exercises` folder. Each also has html copies for easier reference.  
The `ipynb` are all self-contained, with explanations, problem statements and the exercise portion at the end.  
There are also completed mini-puzzles in `quizzes`, and the hints you get after completing them in `hints`.
